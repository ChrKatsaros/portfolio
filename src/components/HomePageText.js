const homeText1 =`Over the past few months, I’ve been fully immersed in web development — learning everything from scratch and discovering a real passion for front-end design.

I’ve built a strong base in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and while I’m still exploring the backend, I’m most excited about crafting user interfaces that look great and feel intuitive.

I’m always experimenting with new tools, design ideas, and trends — whether from AI, quick tutorials, or even TikTok. I love the creativity behind code, and I see the web as a space where ideas come to life.

I’m still early in my journey, but I’m driven, fast-learning, and eager to keep growing as a developer."
