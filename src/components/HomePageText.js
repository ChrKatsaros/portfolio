const homeText1 =`Over the last few months, I’ve been learning web development mostly on my own.  
  I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  
  While I have some basic understanding of backend, my main passion is working with modern front-end technologies and constantly improving my skills.  
  I love exploring new tools — like AI-powered assistants and quick tutorials (yes, even TikTok!) — that help me grow and keep up to date.  
  I may still be a junior developer, but I’m motivated, curious, and excited to keep learning, creating, and evolving every day.`
