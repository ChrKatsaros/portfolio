const homeText1 =`Over the last few months, I’ve been diving deep into web development, teaching myself everything from the ground up. I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and while I have a basic grasp of backend concepts, my true passion lies in modern front-end development. I’m especially drawn to the creative side of web development — bringing ideas to life visually, crafting engaging user experiences, and building interfaces that not only work well but also feel intuitive and inspiring.

I love exploring new tools, techniques, and trends — whether it’s through AI-powered coding assistants, quick tutorials, or even unexpected sources like tech content on TikTok. I believe in learning fast, iterating often, and staying curious. Even though I’m still early in my journey as a developer, I’m committed, highly motivated, and constantly evolving. I see web development not just as code, but as a powerful form of digital creativity — and I’m excited to keep growing, building, and pushing myself every day.
